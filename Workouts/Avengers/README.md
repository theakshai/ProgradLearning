[] Work in Progress.

#### Task:

- The task is to build a Avengers theme web app where we need to show the stones, thanos movements in the map. Based on this we need to send troop to that place. This should be done with the help of google maps api, marvel api. You must show the proficiency of Js using async programming.

#### My Approach:

- I Approached this problem without using API. As there is no API for the necessary info and building my own will be out of scope for this project. As this project is to showcase the responsiveness, best use of javascript and the logic I sticked with the basic javascipt functions.
